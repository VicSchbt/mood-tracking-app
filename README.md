## The Challenge

Your users should be able to:

- Log their mood, feelings, reflections, and sleep each day
- See today's mood, feelings, reflection, and sleep, once logged
- See a relevant mood quote based on today's mood (`data.json`)
- See a graph showing the most recent eleven records to identify mood and sleep trends
- Interact with each bar on the mood and sleep trends chart to see details about that day
- See their average mood and sleep from the past five check-ins and compare with the previous five
- Update their name or avatar through settings
- View a responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements
- **Bonus**:
  - Persist details to a database (full-stack)
  - Add user authentication
  - Integrate a third-party image-hosting service for avatar upload

## My Process
### Built With
Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)

Tailwind CSS (with custom tokens from Figma)

clsx â€“ conditional classNames

date-fns â€“ for date manipulation

zod â€“ for schema validation

json-server (optional backend mock)

Mobile-first layout strategy

Custom font: Reddit Sans

### Folder Structure
```bash
/public
/src
  â”œâ”€â”€ /app
  â”œâ”€â”€ /components
  â”œâ”€â”€ /data
  â”œâ”€â”€ /lib
  â”œâ”€â”€ /types
  â””â”€â”€ /styles
tailwind.config.ts
next.config.js
```
### What I Learned
A few key takeaways from this project:

How to configure Tailwind to match a full design system from Figma (custom spacing, colors, font sizes, radius).

Used next/font/google to optimize Google Fonts (Reddit Sans) loading.

Practiced mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind's utility classes.

Built a clean and accessible UI from Figma specs.

### Continued Development
In future projects, Iâ€™d like to explore:

Animation libraries (Framer Motion, GSAP)

Backend integration (PostgreSQL + Prisma + Next.js API routes)

Authentication using NextAuth or Clerk

Data visualization improvements

### Useful Resources
Tailwind Docs â€“ great for checking class behavior

Figma Tokens plugin â€“ useful to extract design values

Zod docs â€“ schema validation examples

Next.js App Router Guide â€“ essential for the new app structure

## Getting Started
Clone the repo

Install dependencies: npm install

Start dev server: npm run dev

Navigate to http://localhost:3000

To simulate a backend:

```bash
npm install -D json-server
json-server --watch src/data/data.json --port 3001
```
